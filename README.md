Created this Simple Newsletter Signup Form using HTML, Tailwind CSS and a little sprinkle of JavaScript. :)
My very first project using tailwind css, which isn't guided. I've been using media queries to make my projects responsive before, but I guess its time for me to use tailwind css for my future responsive websites.!
